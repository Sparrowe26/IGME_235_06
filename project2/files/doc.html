    <h1>Emoji Central Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Progress Overview</h2>
    <p>Starting out, I wanted to make an application that utilized the <a href="https://emojihub.herokuapp.com/">Emoji
            Hub API</a>
        and allowed the user to search and sort emojis based on category and groups within those
        categories. Initially, I also wanted a random function that displayed a desired number of random emojis,
        but due to how the API handled random emojis through a separate link that generated one at a time,
        I ended up changing that function to also using the sorting functions from earlier. With the current way the
        random generation
        works, it only generates one at a time per button click, but you can limit the randomness by restricting it to
        certain categories or groups. Also, I initially had the following image as my proposed layout:
    </p>

    <p>However, while creating the website, I ended up changing it slightly to have my controls up top with
        the generated emojis below.
        <br>
        Figuring out how to filter by category went pretty smoothly, but since only the first three categories
        had groups within them, I wanted to make the group selector only show up when those few categories were
        selected.
        <br>
        Also different from the proposed image was how I planned to implement favorites. I wanted the favorites
        list to be updated when emojis were clicked, and that stayed constant until the end of the project,
        but instead of having a "show favorites" option in the controls, I opted to create an input field and
        add clicked emojis to that instead. Because I used an input field in the final project, I made it so you
        could easily remove favorites by deleting them from the field, as well as added a copy to clipboard button
        which allows the user to copy their selected emojis with the push of a button. Figuring that whole situation
        out took me a ton of time, trial, and error to figure out, but I'm very satisfied with how it ended up.
