        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Goal: Tell a narrative story through the form of a fictional travel article.<br>
            <br>
            The audience could be anyone interested in fantasy worlds, so when it comes to design/organization, 
            I want the audience to be able to formulate the story of the world being described with no 
            prior knowledge of the source.<br>
            <br>
            Challenges:<br>
            This design was particularly challenging due to the extra floating 
            text boxes all throughout the page. In order to achieve this, I created 
            a grid overlapping the entire page by using absolute positioning. It took me 
            a while to figure out, but once I did, positioning of those elements became 
            much easier.<br>
            <br>
            Mobile Layout:<br>
            Constructing the mobile layout I planned was more difficult than I thought, 
            so I ended up simplifying it slightly as I went. Especially because the text boxes 
            seemed like they would be much too small with the tentative layout.<br>
            <br>
            Navigation:<br>
            Navigation was a bit difficult as links didn't work if they were positioned underneath 
            the floating grid. So, I had to also add it to the grid.
